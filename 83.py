83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]

Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]


Solution:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        current = head

        while current is not None and current.next is not None:
            if current.val == current.next.val:
                current.next = current.next.next
            else:
                current = current.next

        return head

Mistakes:
- This was my first Linked List question after a long time, so chose an easy one to revise traversal
